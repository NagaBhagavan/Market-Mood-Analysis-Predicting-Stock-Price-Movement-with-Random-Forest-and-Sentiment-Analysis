# Market-Mood-Analysis-Predicting-Stock-Price-Movement-with-Random-Forest-and-Sentiment-Analysis


## Executive Summary
Our project combines machine learning techniques with sentiment analysis to predict stock price movements. Leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, we analyze historical stock data alongside sentiment extracted from news and social media. By integrating these two approaches, our model aims to provide investors with valuable insights into potential price fluctuations, enabling informed decision-making in the dynamic stock market landscape.

## Problem Statement
### Background
Fluctuating inventory levels of seasonal products result in financial loss and customer dissatisfaction.

### Objective
Forecast inventory requirements for seasonal products in the upcoming season.

### Scope
Analyze five primary seasonal product categories across ten major locations to optimize inventory management.

## Data Sources
### Primary Data
Data obtained from the official website of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) offers insights into stock market trends and performance.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
Retrieve historical stock price data and sentiment data from reliable sources.

### Data Preparation
Clean, handle missing values, and preprocess data for both stock and sentiment datasets.

### Analysis Techniques
Utilize Random Forest algorithm for stock price prediction and sentiment analysis for market sentiment insights.

### Tools
- **Excel** for preliminary analysis
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, TextBlob for modeling and sentiment analysis

## Expected Outcomes
- Accurate predictions of future stock price movements based on historical data and sentiment analysis.
- Identification of key factors influencing stock price changes, including both quantitative and sentiment-based indicators.
- Improved understanding of market sentiment and its impact on stock prices.
- Enhanced decision-making capabilities for investors and traders by incorporating sentiment analysis into stock price prediction models.

## Risks and Challenges
- **Data Quality**: Ensure accuracy and completeness of historical data.
- **Overfitting**: Guard against models memorizing the training data.
- **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**: Validate sentiment analysis results.
- **External Factors**: Be prepared for unforeseen market events.
- **Computational Resources**: Allocate sufficient resources for data processing.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to financial regulations.
- **Interpretability**: Ensure models' results are understandable and actionable.

## Conclusion
The integration of Random Forest modeling and sentiment analysis presents a promising approach for enhancing stock price prediction and trading strategies. Despite challenges in data quality and model interpretability, the potential benefits in accuracy and risk management justify further exploration and refinement of these techniques. Continued collaboration and research will drive advancements in leveraging data science for informed decision-making in financial markets.
